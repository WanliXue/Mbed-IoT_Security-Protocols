# Mbed-IoT_Security-Protocols
All the GFN protocols used were referenced form an open source, coded in C++ language and are slightly modified to support the functionality and performance evaluation for this project. They are successfully deployed in STM32F401RE MCU with mbed packages.  

PICCOLO: It is an Ultra Light Weight 64-bit blockcipher. It supports Key Size of 80 and 128-bit keys.

CLEFIA: It is an Ultra Light Weight 64-bit blockcipher. It supports Key Size of 128 and 192 and 256-bit keys.

TWINE: It is an Ultra Light Weight 64-bit blockcipher. It supports Key Size of 80 and 128-bit keys.
